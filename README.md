ConnectX GUI

A GUI allows for a person to communicate with some code.

The code uses symbols, visual metaphors, and pointing devices to allow for interaction with the user.

This particular GUI allows the user to play a game of "Connect X" with 2-25 players and with a board size of 3 columns/rows to 19 columns/rows.
